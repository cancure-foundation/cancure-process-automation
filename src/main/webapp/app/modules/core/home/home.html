					<div class="light-text">Stop dreading cancer</div>
					<div class="dark-text">prevent it.</div>
					<p>It's a myth to belive that getting cancer is simply due to
						bad luck or genetic factors. Experts belive that up to half of
						cases can be prevented through lifestyle changes. It is never too
						late to make changes to your lifestyles.</p>
					<p>Around 10% of cancers diagnosed are associated with poor
						dietary lifestyles. A great number more lives can be saved if
						people with symptoms seek help and get treated earlier. Why not do
						our bit ot spread awareness on the needy for early detection and
						prevention of cancer?</p>

					<div class="light-text">Cancer is fatal</div>
					<div class="dark-text">if not treated in time.</div>
					<p>Cancer becomes deadly if not diagnosed and treated in time.
						Timely medication and proper treatment can cure cancer. However,
						we see cancer taking away the lives every day - especially the
						less fortunate amongst us who cannot afford expensive treatment
						facilities and costly medicines.</p>
					<p>They are left to perish and with them the hopes of their
						entire families. Can't we step in to help them in their hour of
						need and save such precious lives?</p>

					<div class="light-text">Life after cancer</div>
					<div class="dark-text">the tornado effect.</div>
					<p>What is more frightening than cancer is the impact of
						cancer. An attack of cancer can have devastating effects on the
						patients and their families. While treatment drains their savings
						on the one hand, cancer leaves them incapable of generating income
						on the other.</p>
					<p>Picking up the broken pieces and beginning life all over
						again in the aftermath of a cancer attack can be more threatening
						than the disease itself. Can't we extend a helping hand to usher
						these families back into the mainstream society?</p>

			<p>Cancure Foundation takes all efforts to identify the needy and
				provide support when and where it's needed the most. Many a times
				the expense for the treatment of cancer is quite exorbitant. Mother
				Teresa once said, "Everything we do is only a drop in the ocean. But
				the ocean would be poorer, if not for each drop".</p>
			<p>Even a contribution as low as Rs. 1000/- would add up to
				settle one patient's medical bills. So do not hesitate to contact us
				to connect, collaborate and contribute. A rupee spared could be a
				life saved!</p>
			<p>All donations to Cancure Foundation are exempt u/s 80 G of the
				Income tax Act.</p>
