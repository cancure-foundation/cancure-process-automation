						<p>It's a myth to belive that getting cancer is simply due to bad luck or genetic factors. Experts belive that up to half of cases can be prevented through lifestyle changes. It is never too late to make changes to your lifestyles.</p>
						<p>Around 10% of cancers diagnosed are associated with poor dietary lifestyles. A great number more lives can be saved if people with symptoms seek help and get treated earlier. Why not do our bit ot spread awareness on the needy for early detection and prevention of cancer?</p>

						<p>Cancer becomes deadly if not diagnosed and treated in time. Timely medication and proper treatment can cure cancer. However, we see cancer taking away the lives of many every day - especially the less fortunate amongst us who cannot afford expensive treatment facilities and costly medicines.</p>
						<p>They are left to perish and with them the hopes of their entire families. Can't we step in to help them in their hour of need and save such precious lives?</p>

						<p>What is more frightening than cancer is the impact of cancer. An attack of cancer can have devastating effects on the patients and their families. While treatment drains their savings on the one hand, cancer leaves them incapable of generating income on the other.</p>
						<p>Picking up the broken pieces and beginning life all over again in the aftermath of a cancer attack can be more threatening than the disease itself. Can't we extend a helping hand to usher these families back into the mainstream society?</p>
