			<h1><img src="../images/v1/Santhwana.png" style="width:75px; height:75px;" alt="santhwana"/> SANTHWANA KENDRAM - CARING FOR THE ORPHANED</h1>
			<br/>

<iframe width="560" height="315" style="max-width:100%;" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qOKYML1h-tA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br/><br/>
			The need for a palliative care and rehabilitation center got initiated  sighting the plight of the poor and abandoned patients who  are terminally ill and housed at the isolation ward of the General Hospital, Ernakulam. It is not uncommon to hear reports regarding many unfortunate victims of fate who end up in hospital with diseases, without anyone claiming for that person, and then becoming destitute who have no other place to go even after discharge from the Hospital. The existing isolation ward at the General Hospital is already overcrowded and the patients are forced to sleep on the floor and even in the corridors. A team of volunteers lead by Mr. Peter is today doing whatever possible to take care of these hapless patients at the General Hospital, Ernakulam. Mr. Peter requested Cancure Foundation to set up an exclusive center to take care of such terminally sick and poor patients who have nowhere to go after discharge, where he and his team can provide their services. Thus was born Cancure Santhwana Kendram -our humble effort to add life and color to the twilight days of those less fortunate and an attempt to grant them a graceful and peaceful exit. <br/> <br/>
			
			<h1>BPCL Donates 50 lakhs</h1>
			<img src="../images/v1/bpclLogo.jpg" class="img-responsive"  /><br>
			BPCL Kochi Refinery has decided to donate Rs 50 Lakh as their CSR contribution to Cancure for its Santhwana Kendram project 
			and hence becoming the First Platinum Partner of the Project. By this contribution one floor of the centre will be named after BPCL. 
			A formal letter on this effect was handed over by Mr. Prasad K Paniker, Executive Director of BPCL Kochi Refineries during the Annual 
			General Meeting of the Foundation. We sincerely thank and express our gratitude towards this kind gesture of BPCL for their Contribution 
			towards the project which is a major milestone in the Foundation's history. <br><br>

			<h1>GOOD SAMARITANS OF THE CENTER</h1>
			The operations at the Rehabilitation and Palliative Care Center will be lead by Mr. Peter and his team of volunteers. Thier work will be complemented by a team of professionals who have the expertise and experience of running Palliative Centers with nursing support. Apart from them, we will also have a small administration team, a visiting Doctor, Kitchen staff, visiting counselors and research students at the center. 
			
			<h1>PROJECT COST</h1>
			The construction of the Santhwana Kendram (Rehabilitation and Palliative Care Center) is expected to be completed in a yearâ€™s time and a conservative estimate is that the civil work, plumping, electrical, interiors and equipments would cost approximately Rs. 3 Crores.
